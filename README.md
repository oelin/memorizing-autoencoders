# Ephemeral Autoencoders

Research on ephemeral autoencoders.


## About

Ephemeral autoencoders are a family of autoencoder models which learn embeddings by intentionally overfitting to a small number of training examples. Remarkably, these models tend to learn highly generalized embeddings which can be used to efficiently compress out-of-distribution data. The most direct application of ephemeral AEs is lossly image and speach compression.
